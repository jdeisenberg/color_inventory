# About the Color Inventory

Let’s say you have a photo of a product or a place, and you want to
design artwork, packaging, etc. to go with it.

One of the things you can do is make a <em>color inventory</em>. You figure
out the main colors in your photo and their proportions, and then you use
that information to design your materials with the same colors in the
same proportions.

Making a color inventory by hand is a laborious task. As a human, you
are fantastic at deciding which colors are the main colors. Figuring
out the proportions accurately isn’t so easy. This program, then, is
meant to assist you. You point out the colors, and the computer
calculates the proportions, because computers are great at doing
calculations.

The idea for this program came from [Amir Esfahani](http://www.saberesfahani.com/),
who teaches art at Skyline College in San Bruno, CA and is the director of the
Artist in Residency program for the Internet Archive. Amir also
did the CSS to make the color inventory look nice. 

<p><small>*Note: It would be great if a program could automatically derive
the color inventory from the photo. However, this is not something
that computers are particularly good at. (Unless programmed by someone
who knows more about machine learning than I do—which is just about
everyone.)</small></p>
